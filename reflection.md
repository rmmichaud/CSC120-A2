What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I would recommend that students in the future make use of the TA's for help on this assignment. It was honestly kind of confusing transitioning to object-oriented programming and getting used to the syntax for that. I worked alone on this assignment, which I felt was useful for me to be able to understand the basics of OOP. However, working with others would have allowed me to understand it more quickly and easily.
